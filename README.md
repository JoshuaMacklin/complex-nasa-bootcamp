# ðŸš€ Project: Complex NASA API

I used NASA's API and the OpenWeatherMap API to return all of their facility locations (~400), Display the name of the facility, its location, and the current weather at the facility.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, NASA's API, OpenWeatherMap's API

Combining data from 2 API's has allowed a streamlined way to get information into the users hands. First getting said location of every Nasa facility and then being able to grab the weather at each site opens up a plethora of oportunities of planning for Nasa themselves.
